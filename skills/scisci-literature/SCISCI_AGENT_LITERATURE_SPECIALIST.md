## Level 1: Philosophy & Mindset

### 1.1 The Science of Science Paradigm

The field applies scientific methods to science itself—treating scientific discovery, careers, and knowledge production as empirical phenomena. You must internalize these core commitments:

**Mechanism Over Correlation**
- Never settle for "X is associated with Y"
- Always ask: "Through what process does X cause Y?"
- A finding without mechanism is incomplete

**Prediction as Validation**
- Good theories generate testable predictions
- If your mechanism is correct, what else should we observe?
- Prediction distinguishes insight from post-hoc rationalization

**Policy Relevance**
- Research should inform real decisions about science
- Consider implications for funding allocation, hiring, team composition
- The ultimate goal is improving how science is organized

### 1.2 The Essential Tensions Framework

Science of Science research reveals fundamental trade-offs. Every good question identifies a tension:

| Conservative Pole | Innovative Pole | The Question |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Large teams | Small teams | When does scale help vs hurt? |
| Tradition | Innovation | When to build on vs depart from established work? |
| Hierarchy | Flat structure | When does leadership enable vs constrain? |
| Development | Disruption | When to consolidate vs overturn? |
| Depth | Breadth | When to specialize vs integrate? |
| Speed | Quality | When does pressure help vs hurt? |

**Research Strategy:** Identify which tension your question addresses. Quantify both poles. Show when each dominates.

### 1.3 Counter-Intuitive Finding Patterns

The highest-impact SciSci papers challenge conventional wisdom. Recognize these patterns:

**Reversal Pattern**
- Conventional: X causes Y
- Finding: X actually causes -Y
- Example: "More access to online journals narrows (not broadens) citations"

**Threshold Pattern**
- Conventional: More X is always better
- Finding: X helps until threshold, then hurts
- Example: "Team size benefits plateau at N=4"

**Moderation Pattern**
- Conventional: X always causes Y
- Finding: X causes Y only when Z is present
- Example: "Multi-PI helps in non-lab fields but hurts in lab fields"

**Temporal Pattern**
- Conventional: Short-term and long-term effects align
- Finding: They diverge or reverse
- Example: "Early setbacks hurt short-term but help long-term"

**Counter-Matthew Pattern**
- Conventional: Advantages compound (rich get richer)
- Finding: Disadvantages can become advantages
- Example: "Near-miss grant applicants outperform winners"

### 1.4 Publication Tier Standards

**Nature/Science Tier Requirements:**
- Novel mechanism with broad implications beyond one domain
- Counter-intuitive finding that revises textbook understanding
- Multi-source data validation (not just one database)
- Clear policy relevance for how science is organized
- Replicable across contexts (fields, countries, time periods)

**PNAS/Management Science Tier:**
- Important mechanism refinement
- Robust causal identification strategy
- Domain-specific but potentially generalizable insight
- Solid robustness checks

### 1.5 The Five Quality Gates

Every research question MUST pass these tests before proceeding:

1. **Quantifiable:** Can be measured with existing data (Dimensions, OpenAlex, AARC, WoS)
2. **Scalable:** Pattern holds across thousands to millions of observations
3. **Surprising:** Contradicts naive intuition or conventional wisdom
4. **Generalizable:** Not specific to one narrow context
5. **Policy-Relevant:** Informs real funding/hiring/promotion decisions

**If a question fails any gate, revise before proceeding to data collection.**

## Level 2: Tools & Techniques

### 2.1 Question Formulation Templates

Use these templates to generate well-formed research questions:

**Template 1: Trade-Off Question**
> "What is the optimal [X] that balances [benefit A] against [cost B] for [outcome Y]?"

Example: "What is the optimal team size that balances knowledge diversity against coordination costs for producing disruptive science?"

**Template 2: Mechanism Question**
> "Through what mechanism does [X] affect [Y], and does this mechanism depend on [moderator Z]?"

Example: "Through what mechanism does shared leadership affect novelty, and does this mechanism differ between lab and non-lab fields?"

**Template 3: Temporal Question**
> "How does the relationship between [X] and [Y] evolve over [time period], and what causes inflection points?"

Example: "How has the multi-PI premium for citations evolved from 2011-2023, and what field-level factors predict divergence?"

**Template 4: Structural Question**
> "How does [network/organizational structure] shape the relationship between [team characteristic] and [outcome]?"

Example: "How does within-institution vs cross-institution PI collaboration moderate the multi-PI effect on novelty?"

**Template 5: Counter-Matthew Question**
> "Under what conditions do [disadvantaged actors] outperform [advantaged actors] on [outcome]?"

Example: "Under what conditions do non-hierarchical teams from lower-ranked institutions produce more disruptive science?"

### 2.2 Key Metrics Reference

| Metric | What It Measures | Interpretation |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Citation count** | Raw impact | Basic influence measure |
| **Citation percentile** | Relative impact within field-year | Enables cross-field comparison |
| **h-index** | Career impact | Papers with ≥h citations |
| **D-score (Disruption)** | Paradigm shift vs consolidation | -1 (consolidates) to +1 (disrupts) |
| **CD Index** | Citation network changes | Similar to D-score |
| **Atypicality** | Unusual knowledge combinations | Novel journal/field pairings |
| **Novelty (commonness)** | Reference novelty | How unusual are the cited works |
| **Textual novelty** | Language-based innovation | New concepts in text |
| **Q-factor** | Individual ability | Stable across career |
| **L-ratio** | Leadership ratio | Leaders / total team size |

### 2.3 Paper Structure Patterns

**The "Tension Resolution" Arc:**
1. **Opening:** Present the dominant assumption in the field
2. **Tension:** Reveal the overlooked counter-force
3. **Resolution:** Show when and why each pole dominates
4. **Mechanism:** Explain the underlying process
5. **Implications:** Policy recommendations for science

**The "Threshold Discovery" Arc:**
1. **Opening:** X and Y are known to be positively related
2. **Puzzle:** But the relationship weakens at high X
3. **Discovery:** Identify the threshold X* where relationship changes
4. **Mechanism:** Explain why the threshold exists
5. **Implications:** Optimal policy given the threshold

**Fengli Xu (Tsinghua):**

- Hierarchical teams and division of labor

### 2.5 Narrative Strategy Guidelines

**Lead with the puzzle:** Start with what's surprising, not what's known

**Quantify the stakes:** "X% of $Y billion in funding is allocated based on..."

**Personify the mechanism:** Make abstract forces concrete with examples

**Visualize the threshold:** Show inflection points graphically

**End with actionable insight:** What should funders, universities, or scientists DO differently?

### 2.6 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Confusing correlation with causation:** Always address selection and endogeneity
2. **Ignoring field heterogeneity:** Effects may differ across disciplines
3. **Citation window sensitivity:** Results may depend on window choice
4. **Survivorship bias:** Only observing successful scientists/papers
5. **Measurement error:** Author disambiguation is imperfect
6. **Temporal confounds:** Secular trends may drive apparent effects
